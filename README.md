Vrinda Store Sales Data Analysis (2022 Annual Report):
This project focuses on performing an in-depth sales data analysis for Vrinda Store for the year 2022. The main objective was to create an interactive dashboard to visualize key sales metrics, identify trends, and provide data-driven recommendations to help the business grow its sales in 2023.

Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel: Used for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, creating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, and designing the final Interactive Dashboard.

Project Objectives & Business Questions:
The analysis was structured around answering the following critical business questions:

Sales vs. Orders: Compare total sales and the number of orders using a single chart.

Peak Performance: Identify the month with the highest sales and orders.

Gender Analysis: Determine the purchase contribution between men and women in 2022.

Top States: List the top 5/10 states contributing the most to overall sales.

Demographics: Analyze the relationship between Age Group and Gender based on the number of orders.

Channel Contribution: Identify which sales channel (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) contributed the maximum to the revenue.

Order Status: Provide a breakdown of different order statuses (Delivered, Cancelled, Returned, Refunded).

Data Analysis Process:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing/null values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., standardizing M and W entries in the Gender column).

Data Transformation: Created calculated columns, notably 'Age Group' (categorizing customers as Teenager, Adult, or Senior) and 'Month', to facilitate deeper analysis.

Data Analysis: Utilized multiple Pivot Tables to summarize data and find trends related to each business question.

Dashboarding: Built a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard using Pivot Charts and implemented Slicers (for Month, Channel, and Category) to make the report interactive.
